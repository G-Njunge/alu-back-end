"""
This script retrieves and displays an employee's completed tasks from a fake REST API.

The program uses the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch:
- Employee details (name)
- Tasks assigned to the employee

It then prints:
- The employeeâ€™s name
- How many tasks they have completed out of the total
- The titles of all completed tasks

Usage:
    python3 script_name.py <employee_id>

Example:
    python3 employee_tasks.py 2
